\paragraph{Introduction}
Weather catastrophes, including hurricanes, tornados, wildfires, hail storms, and other extreme weather events, have been increasingly 
prevalent and severe in recent years. These events pose significant risks to homeowners and carry substantial financial implications. 
This research proposal aims to investigate how the frequency and severity of weather catastrophes impact the pricing of property 
insurance policies and to identify strategies that can be developed to mitigate the financial burden on homeowners. Previous studies 
in the field \citep[e.g.,][]{kraehnert2021} have provided valuable insights, and we seek to build upon their findings.
