\paragraph{Introduction}
Weather catastrophes, including hurricanes, tornados, wildfires, hail storms, and other extreme weather events, have been increasingly 
prevalent and severe in recent years. These events pose significant risks to homeowners and carry substantial financial implications. 
This research proposal aims to investigate how the frequency and severity of weather catastrophes impact the pricing of property 
insurance policies and to identify strategies that can be developed to mitigate the financial burden on homeowners. Previous studies 
in the field \citep[e.g.,][]{kraehnert2021} have provided valuable insights, and we seek to build upon their findings. 

\paragraph{Specific Aims}
Our study focuses on three main objectives pertaining to weather catastrophes and property insurance pricing. To start with, we seek 
to explore the overarching research query: ``What is the impact of weather catastrophe frequency and severity on home insurance policy 
prices, and how can homeowners alleviate financial strain?`` This fundamental inquiry will serve as the basis for our investigation.

To examine this question thoroughly, we intend to analyze how variations in insured loss over time correlate with changes in both the 
frequency and severity of weather catastrophes such as hurricanes, tornados, wildfires, and hail storms. By studying these factors' 
influence on policy pricing fluctuations, we aim to gain a comprehensive understanding of their interplay.

Moreover, we plan to convert this primary research question into specific statistical inquiries that employ data science techniques. 
These focused queries include evaluating whether there exists a correlation between weather catastrophe occurrence rates and 
alterations in insured loss over time. Additionally, through data-driven analysis methods, we aim to identify effective strategies 
for alleviating homeowners' financial burdens caused by these catastrophic events.

By successfully achieving these aims through quantitative methodologies rooted in data science principles, our research endeavors 
hold promise for providing valuable insights that can inform practices within the insurance industry. Finally, this knowledge has 
potential implications for public policy decisions aimed at enhancing disaster resilience amidst escalating climate-related risks.


\paragraph{Data}
We will primarily rely on information acquired from reputable sources for our research, particularly the Insurance Information 
Institute (III), which has regularly offered thorough information on catastrophic occurrences and its consequences. We will also 
depend on Aon's 2023 Weather, Climate, and Catastrophe Insight Report, which acts as a trustworthy and up-to-date reference for data 
regarding catastrophic events. This report delivers in-depth insights into the frequency, severity, and financial effects of numerous 
weather-related catastrophes, including hurricanes, wildfires, severe storms, and more. The III gathers information on the frequency 
and severity of catastrophic events, the insured losses incurred, and their effects on the insurance industry, using Aon as one of 
its main references. Data on current trends and patterns in weather catastrophes and their economic effects can be found in Aon's 
2023 report. Additionally, information on insured and uninsured losses, claim histories, and regional effects can all be found in 
this report which are crucial to our analysis. The report includes a variety of factors, such as the frequency of weather disasters, 
their geographic distribution, the financial losses connected to each incident, and the degree to which these losses are insured. 
In addition, the report provides information on demographics, policy coverage specifics, and insurance premiums, enabling us to 
investigate the connection between weather catastrophes and home insurance premiums.
