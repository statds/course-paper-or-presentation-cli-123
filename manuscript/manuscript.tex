\begin{abstract}
Weather catastrophes, like hurricanes, wildfires, hail storms, etc., have become more common and severe in recent years, which poses 
significant risks to homeowners and has significant financial consequences. The purpose of this research paper is to look into the 
impact of weather catastrophe frequency and severity on property insurance policy prices, and also, to identify strategies for easing 
the financial burden on homeowners. This research combines statistical analysis and data science techniques, drawing on data from 
reliable sources such as the Insurance Information Institute and Aon's 2023 Weather, Climate, and Catastrophe Insight Report. The 
research aims to provide helpful insights into the relationships between the frequency and severity of weather catastrophes and 
property insurance pricing in order to inform insurance industry practices and public policy decisions to improve resilience to 
catastrophes.
